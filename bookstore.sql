This intriguing introduction to modern art examines the avant-garde from its nineteenth-century origins in Paris to its meaning and influence today. It presents the visionaries who took the greatest risks, who saw the furthest, and who made the most challenging art-art that changed how we imagine our world.

Small discoveries yield profound insights. William Stafford notices, in the last line of his belated poem “When I Was Young,” that “The clocks, though, still pursue what they endlessly loved.”We, like Stafford, are surprised by the obvious.

The book contains a selection of poems written by the author between the years of 1949 and 1954, during a period of personal and spiritual transformation. The poems explore themes of nature, love, and spirituality, often drawing on Everson\'s experiences as a poet, monk, and lover. The collection is known for its vivid imagery, lyrical language, and deep spiritual insight. The title of the book refers to the idea that God\'s plan for humanity is not always straightforward, and that the path to enlightenment is often full of twists and turns. The Crooked Lines Of God is considered a classic of American poetry, and is widely regarded as one of Everson\'s most important works.This scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the old original and may contain some imperfections such as library marks and notations.');
